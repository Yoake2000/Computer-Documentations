- # Prerequisites
	- External Monitor Brightness are not controllable from within the desktop GUI without 3rd-party programs.
	- Information for controlling the display brightness (and other options) from within Linux is documented by [this article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/backlight) from the Archlinux Wiki.
		- `ddcutil` is a cli program used to query and set those settings. `ddcui` is a graphical user interface for ddcutil and is [available on the AUR.](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ddcui)
