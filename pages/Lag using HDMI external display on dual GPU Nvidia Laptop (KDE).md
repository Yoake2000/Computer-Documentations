- There is an issue when using external displays on dual GPU nvidia (hybrid) laptops like HP Victus 16 and connecting them to an HDMI port(mostly), the output is laggy/stuttering and looks like its being rendered with significantly lower frame rate than is set. The lag is apparent on animations that are expected to be smooth such as scrolling webpages, changing desktop workspace, etc.
- I've also experienced this on windows when inserting the monitor to an already booted up laptop. The issue disappears though after a restart.
- Reading through forum posts with people that experienced the same problem, the problem can be traced to how Linux handles GPU offloading, specifically on [Reverse PRIME.](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PRIME) So far I haven't seen someone with a dual GPU that is using an AMD GPU that has this problem. This may have been a problem for hybrid Nvidia laptops specially without a MUX switch since offloading is not optional for these kinds of laptops. A lot pins the blame on the Nvidia drivers, some on the compositor and/or the Wayland protocol. I haven't tried X11 on KDE to test if the problem persists there but as far
