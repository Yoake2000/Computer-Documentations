# Prerequisites
	- Linux uses `acpi-cpufreq` or `amd-pstate` as the default scaling drivers for the CPU. As of the writing of this guide, `amd-pstate` is widely used by different distros for AMD processors. Configuring the scaling driver to use different drivers for different power states can improve power and performance efficiency as well as manage temperatures.
	- [`amd_pstate` has three operation modes](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling#amd_pstate):`active`,`passive` and `guided` . From a [phoronix article testing the amd_pstate 'passive' and 'active' mode along with `acpi-freq` performance](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-pstate-epp-ryzen-mobile), it is evident that `active` mode implemented by  `amd_pstate_epp` driver performs the best considering power consumption, cpu temperature and  computing performance. ~~So far I haven't found any testing that includes the `guided` mode, as such this guide only considers the `active` mode only.~~ There are discussions on the [Phoronix forums](https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/hardware/processors-memory/1394900-linux-6-5-now-defaults-to-amd-p-state-active-epp-for-modern-ryzen-systems/page2) regarding the `guided` mode but there is still no definitive testing regarding its performance.
	- The AMD P-state `active` mode is the default now for Ryzen Linux Systems as of [Linux 6.5](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.5-Power-Management).
	- To enable ``amd_pstate_epp`` (AMD P-state `active` mode) scaling driver for AMD Ryzen Processors, the processor needs to be from `zen 2` and newer generations.
	- To check if your device is able to use the scaling driver, `cpcc` support must be checked first using `lscpu | grep cppc`. The output must show `cpcc`. If it didn't, there may be a BIOS/UEFI setting needed to be changed first.
	- For more info about `amd-pstate` and `cpcc`, there is the [kernel documentation.](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/pm/amd-pstate.html)
- # Enabling the P-State EPP Scaling Driver
	- To enable the `amd_pstate_epp` driver, the kernel module parameter `amd_pstate=active` must first be added. This may be unnecessary for newer Linux kernels.
		- For Arch Linux systems using the `refind` boot manager, the kernel parameter can be added on `/boot/refind_linux.conf` or `/boot/EFI/refind/refind.conf` depending on how the boot manager was set up.
		- For other distros and/or boot managers, refer to their respective guides on how to change kernel parameters.
