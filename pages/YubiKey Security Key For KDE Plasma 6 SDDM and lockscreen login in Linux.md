- Yubikey Security Key must first be added as a key for authentication as outline in [[Enabling Authentication in GDM,sudo and Passkey in browsers using Yubikey Security Key]]. Optionally add it as a key for sudo. This page would outline the steps to be done for using the Yubikey Security Key (Yubikey Security Key C NFC) for SDDM login and lockscreen.
- # Use as a second factor authentication (2FA)
	- A useful [github repo](https://github.com/Zer0CoolX/Fedora-KDE-Yubikey-U2F-2FA-Logins-Guide) outlined the steps for using a Yubikey Security Key as 2FA for Fedora KDE Linux. These steps also works for Arch Linux but replacing some steps for the distro specific programs.
		- There are steps for using Yubikey 2FA for `sudo`,`su`,SDDM login screen, KDE Lockscreen and PolicyKit KDE Agent within the repo.
		- For `sudo`, the steps are similar from [[Enabling Authentication in GDM,sudo and Passkey in browsers using Yubikey Security Key]]. Yubikey can also be a sufficient key if `sufficient` parameter is used instead of `required`.
