- Yubikey Security Key must first be added as a key for authentication as outline in [[Enabling Authentication in GDM,sudo and Passkey in browsers using Yubikey Security Key]]. Optionally add it as a key for sudo. This page would outline the steps to be done for using the Yubikey Security Key (Yubikey Security Key C NFC) for SDDM login and lockscreen.
- # Use as a second factor authentication (2FA)
	- A useful [github repo](https://github.com/Zer0CoolX/Fedora-KDE-Yubikey-U2F-2FA-Logins-Guide) outlined the steps for using a Yubikey Security Key as 2FA for Fedora KDE Linux. These steps also works for Arch Linux but replacing some steps for the distro specific programs.
		- There are steps for using Yubikey 2FA for `sudo`,`su`,SDDM login screen, KDE Lockscreen and PolicyKit KDE Agent within the repo.
		- For `sudo`, the steps are similar from [[Enabling Authentication in GDM,sudo and Passkey in browsers using Yubikey Security Key]]. Yubikey can also be a sufficient key if `sufficient` parameter is used instead of `required`.
		- A line in the repo instructions about changing ``auth include system-auth`` to `auth substack system-auth`. I didn't changed the line and haven't tested what are its effects. I don't know how `substack` or `include` affects the authentication.
			- The following links may contain the answers and I still yet to read them:
				- https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/PAMStackingAndStopping
				- https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/pam-configuration-file
				- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system-level_authentication_guide/pam_configuration_files
				- https://www.linux.org/docs/man5/system-auth.html
	- I didn't used the instructions from this repo since I want to use the Yubikey as a sufficient key to login for my computer. For `sudo` and changing `required` to `sufficient`, this works adequately but for the SDDM login screen, even after changing to `sufficient`, a password is still required. For the lockscreen, the instructions and changing to `sufficient` is adequate though.
