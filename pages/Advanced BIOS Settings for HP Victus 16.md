- As of April 12,2024 BIOS Version F.19RevA, there's no possible way to access the BIOS Advanced Settings. Some steps are suggested in this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPVictus/comments/11cimr3/how_to_enter_advanced_settings_in_bios_of_hp/) and from the internet and some of them worked in the previous BIOS versions.
- From the same [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPVictus/comments/11cimr3/how_to_enter_advanced_settings_in_bios_of_hp/), a suggestion from a comment to access the advanced setting was put forth. It leads to a [Smokeless_UMAF](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF?tab=readme-ov-file), where a zip is to be downloaded and to be extracted to a USB drive. The drive is then booted from.
- I extracted the zip to a storage partition in my Ventoy Drive. This would make it not detectable by my specific device (HP Victus 16 Running Arch Linux and Refind Boot Manager) and thus I booted to Ventoy first and browsed for the UiApp.efi file to be booted.
