- In order to help improve battery life on Linux, `ryzenadj` can be useful to limit the power drawn by the CPU.
- Laptops automatically adjusts settings if it is plugged in or running in battery. As stated on the [RyzenAdj Github Wiki](https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj/wiki/Renoir-Tuning-Guide), `power-saving ` or `max-performance` is automatically set depending on the power source and values vary depending on the device.
- Setting much more lower power limits may help on improving the battery life. Thus I want to set the power limit max at 5W. Essentially limiting the CPU performance drastically in exchange for battery life. A [related reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDLaptops/comments/11jjmmc/turned_my_6800h_into_a_6800u_using_ryzenadj/) discusses this comparing it into changing their mobile CPU into its low power equivalent.
- Setting power limits can be done on CLI using:
	- `# ryzenadj  --stapm-limit=5000 --fast-limit=5000 --slow-limit=5000 `
	- needing `sudo` to run
- KDE is able to run commands or scripts when changing power profiles on System Settings > Energy Saving.
