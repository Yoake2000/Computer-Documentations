# Enabling Yubikey Security Key unlock for LUKS Encrypted Root Partition

Note: The LUKS Encrypted Partitions used in my workstation is created by the Arch Linux Script Installer and steps outlined here may differ for case to case basis. The home partition was also encrypted by the script and its decryption follows after the decryption of the root partition. Configurations pertaining to LUKS encryption except for the ones changed in the following steps are unchanged from stock (script installer). 

- Add "sd-encrypt" hook to /etc/mkinitcpio.conf (To test replacing encrypt with sd-encrypt. Currently running both hooks. Relevant discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1307cke/encrypt_vs_sdencrypt_mkinitcpio_hooks/)
- Create file /etc/crypttab.initramfs
	root  UUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX  none  tpm2-device=auto
- Regenerate initramfs. 
	`# sudo mkinitcpi -P`
- Insert Yubikey. Confirm if key is detected 
	`$ systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=list`
- Register key in LUKS slot. 
	`$ systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=auto /dev/sdX`
	/dev/sdX stands for the encrypted partition.
